## About the project

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com.pe/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1677019571_YzYzZWZiM2Q5MDk2).During the execution of the project, we will implement the following functionalities.

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell(perfect for development and debugging).
2. A website(the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
3. A database or files that store data(data = objects).
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data(retrieve, create, delete, update them).
